LSE Course - Module 2 Covid Analysis

<h2>Scenario</h2>

The UK government have requested an analysis of data to help with a marketing campaign with the intention of increasing uptake of the vaccination.
As part of this analysis, the government wants to review trends and patterns that will help with the successful outcome of the marketing campaign.

The key outputs that the government is looking for are:<br>

- <b>Total</b> vaccinations (1st dose, 2nd dose) in total and overtime per region<br>
- Where they should target the first marketing campaign based on: <br>
  -  Largest area with 1st dose but no 2nd dose.<br>
  -  area which has the greatest number of recoveries so that they can be excluded from the campaign. <br>
  -  whether deaths have been increasing across all regions or if a peak has been reached.<br> 
-  Which regions have experienced a peak in hospitalisation numbers and if there are regions which have not yet peaked.
-  What other Twitter data points and tweets have both #coronavirus and #vaccinated hashtags.
